# Secure-Chat-Room
A Chat Room system (client and server - using Python v2.7) that allows users to join into a chat room to converse with other users.
In this implementation of the Chat Room system, we have 
1.Source authentication, i.e., a way to verify that the received data really originates from the claimed source and was not modified en route. 
2. Integrity of the messages, a mechanism to verify the integrity of the messages themselves, prevent replay attacks or account for packet loss.
